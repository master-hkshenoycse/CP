There i a exsiting system ,we have to improve the exsiting monolith architecture so that it can handle
50x traffic and second was we have a prediction model and a prediction service we have to integrate these two feature in our
exsiting system.

Improving Existing Monolith Architecture for 50x Traffic
Current State Assessment:
Understand the current architecture, its components, and how traffic is handled.

Identify potential bottlenecks or scalability limitations.
Scalability Strategy:
Vertical Scaling: Evaluate if increasing resources (CPU, memory) on existing servers can handle increased traffic temporarily.
Horizontal Scaling: Implement load balancing and distribute traffic across multiple instances to handle increased load.
Database Optimization: Review database queries, indexes, and caching strategies to optimize for performance.
Caching Mechanisms: Introduce caching layers (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to store frequently accessed data and reduce database load.
Asynchronous Processing: Use message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for decoupling synchronous operations and handling bursts of traffic.

Infrastructure Changes:
Cloud Migration: Consider moving to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure) for elasticity and scalability benefits.
Containerization: Dockerize components and use Kubernetes for orchestration to manage scalability and deployment.
Testing and Monitoring:

Load Testing: Conduct thorough load testing to simulate 50x traffic and identify performance bottlenecks.
Monitoring Tools: Implement monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for real-time performance metrics and alerting.
Integrating Prediction Model and Service into Existing System
Prediction Model Integration:

Model Deployment: Deploy the prediction model as a service (REST API or microservice).
Data Integration: Ensure seamless data flow between existing system and the prediction service.
Real-Time or Batch Processing: Determine if predictions are real-time or batch processed based on system requirements.
Service Integration:
API Design: Define clear APIs for communication between existing system and prediction service.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and retries to manage service failures or timeouts.
Data Consistency: Ensure consistency between prediction results and existing system data.

Scalability Considerations:
Service Scalability: Design the prediction service to handle concurrent requests and scale horizontally if needed.
Performance Optimization: Optimize prediction algorithms and service infrastructure for low latency responses.
Testing and Validation:

Unit and Integration Testing: Validate prediction service integration with mock data and real-world scenarios.
User Acceptance Testing: Involve stakeholders to validate predictions and ensure accuracy before full deployment.

private Constructor Scenario
Exact Example with Reflection
In Java, making a constructor private is often used in conjunction with the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of a class exists.

java
Copy code
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
Reflection Use Case
Reflection in Java allows you to inspect and manipulate classes, methods, and fields at runtime. If a class has a private constructor and you attempt to create an instance using reflection, you can encounter scenarios where you want to control how and when instances are created, typically for enforcing design patterns like Singleton or preventing unauthorized instantiation.

java
Copy code
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();
        
        // Attempting to create another instance using reflection
        try {
            Class<Singleton> singletonClass = Singleton.class;
            Constructor<Singleton> constructor = singletonClass.getDeclaredConstructor();
            constructor.setAccessible(true); // Allow access to private constructor
            Singleton anotherInstance = constructor.newInstance();
            
            // This will throw an exception or return a new instance depending on your Singleton implementation
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
When to Use Private Constructor with Reflection
Singleton Pattern: To enforce that only one instance of a class exists.
Utility Classes: Classes containing only static methods and no instance variables.
Factory Methods: When using a factory method pattern and want to control object creation.
By using a private constructor, you ensure that instances of the class can only be created internally, maintaining control over how and when objects are instantiated. This is particularly useful for enforcing design patterns and preventing unintended instantiation via reflection or other mechanisms.






is-a relation inheritance


Factory Pattern:
Used when objects are created based on conditional basis.
when these conditions are repetative and used at lot of places in codebase
Eg condition 1 create object 1,else object 2

public interface Shape{
    void draw();
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape{
    @Override
    public void draw(){
        System.out.println("rectangle");
    }
}

public class Circle implements Shape{
    @Override
    public void draw(){
        System.out.println("circle");
    }
}


public class ShapeFactory{

    Shape getShape(String input){
        switch(input){
            case "CIRCLE":
                return new Circle();
            case "RECTANGLE":
                return new Rectangle();
            default:
                null;
        }
    }
}


public class MainClass{

    public static void main(String args[]){
        ShapeFactory shapeFactoryObj=new ShapeFactory();
        Shape shapeObj=shapeFactoryObj.getShape("CIRCLE");
        shapeObj.draw();
    }
}


Abstract Factory Pattern:
Factory  of factory, when the concrete classes can be grouped.

Builder Design Pattern:

It is creational design pattern,  helps in creating of objects.

Eg student class- roll number mandatory , rest all features optional, so lot of  types/size of constructors



constructed using builder object.
concrete




Creational design pattern:
Encaspulate knowledge about which concrete class should be used.
Conceal how objects are crated. 

The Builder pattern
Avoids complex constructors as classes grow in size,Two constructor of a class cant have same signature.
Mandatory and optinoal parameneter/class variables.
Assume object is  immutable.

            (interface)
Director ---> Builder ---> ConcreteBuilder ---> Product(required object)

Product class constructor dependes on concreteBuilder object.
                                           


The Singelton pattern.
Usecases:Config files, connection to database/hardware resources,loggers.
take care of thread safety.
May violate single resposiblity pattern, functinoality+ensuring only 1 instance created hence 2 responsiblities.
Diffcult to test- use dependency injection.
Private constructor
Use synchronised keyword so that two threads cant create new instance at same time ,  bottle neck when called lots of time.
make the class enum.
public class PrintSpool{

    private PrintSpool(){}
    private static PrintSpool INSTANCE;
    
    public static PrintSpool getInstance(){
        if(INSTANCE==NULL){
            INSTANCE=new PrintSpool();
        }
        return INSTANCE;
    }
    void print(){
        System.out.println("Printing ... ");
    }
}

//Thread safe with enum, as enums in java guranteed to be threadsafe, can't be used if singleton class is implementing superclass.

public enum PrintSpool{

    INSTANCE;
    
    public static PrintSpool getInstance(){
        
        return INSTANCE;
    }
    void print(){
        System.out.println("Printing ... ");
    }
}

public class ImagePrinter{
    public void printImage(){
        var spooler=PrintSpool.getInstance();
        spooler.print();
    }
}

The Prototype Pattern:

Grphic   --->        Tree              --->
clone()        (string type,int height)

There is clonebale interface, but avoid it, the interface has no clone method and throws exception that must be handeld.
Useful when creatinfg mutiple copies of same object.
by default shallow copy of original.
pubilc abstract class Meal{

    private int price;

    //contructor
    //getter
    //setter.

    public abstract Meal clone();

}

public class Pizza extends Meal{

    private PizzaFlavour pizzaFlavour;
    public Pizza(int price,PizzaFlavour pizzaFlavour){
        super(price);
        this.flavour=flavour;
    }


    /*For prototype pattern*/
    @Override
    public Pizza clone(){
        //This makes it deep copy by creating new object when cloning.
        return new Pizza(this.getPrice(),new PizzaFlavour(this.getFlavour().getName()));
    }
}

public class PizzaFlavour{
    private string name;
    //contructor
    //getter
    //setter.
}

public class PizzaOrder{

    public static void main(String[]  args){
        PizzaFlavour hawai=new PizzaFlavour("hawai");
        Pizza hp1=new Pizza(4,hawai);
       // Pizza hp2=new Pizza(4,hawai);//duplication
        Pizza hp2=hp1.clone();

        PizzaFlavour panner=new PizzaFlavour("panner");
        Pizza p1=new Pizza(4,panner);
        //Pizza p2=new Pizza(4,panner);
        Pizza p2=p1.clone();

        List<Meal>  order=List.of({hp1,hp2,p1,p2});

    }
}

The Factory Pattern


Ticket machine          ------>  ticket  ----/\
createTicket(String ticketType)           Bus  Train

Use facotory pattern when a class has to create instances of another class , but it does not know in advance what the concrete type
it would be.

public interface Ticket{
    int getPrice();
}

public class BusTicket implements Ticket{
    @Override
    public int getPrice(){
        return 3;
    }
}

public class TrainTicket implements Ticket{
    @Override
    public int getPrice(){
        return 5;
    }
}

public class TicketOffce{
    private static final TicketMachine ticketMachine=new TicketMachine();
}

//import map and supplier.
public class TicketMachine{

    private static final Map<String,Supplier<Ticket>> ticketMap=new HashMap();
    static{
       // supplier is interface which takes no argument and returns a object
        ticketMap.put("Bus", () -> new BusTicket());
        ticketMap.put("Train", TrainTicket::new);

    }
    Ticket crateTicket(String type){
        if(ticketMap.get(type) != null){
            return ticketMap.get(type).get();
        }else{
            thrw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid type");
        }

        
        
    }
}

The Abstract Factories Pattern

Requirements:
The system should be independent of how objects are created.
It should be configured with one of multiple families of objects.
The family of related objects should be used together.

Concrete classes are isolated from the client.
Each section is easily testable.


STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS

class pattens are concernced with is-a relationship, focus on inheritance.
Object patterns allow to change behaviour at runtime, focus on has-a relationship.


The Adapter pattern.
working with legacy codebase,class and object adapter.
Adapter has an instance if adaptee as a field.

Adapter ----> Adaptee
       has-a


public class OnlineApplication{
    private final DocuementUploader documentUploader;
    //getter
    //setter
}

public interface DocuementUploader{
    public void uploadDocument();
}

pdfUploader implements DocuementUploader{

}

WordDocument (a seprate class)

WordDocumentAdapter implements DocuementUploader{

}

To not change existsing class's code but extend the behaivior

WordDocumentAdapter extends WordDocumentUploader implements DocuementUploader{

    Overide methods of original
}


The Bridge pattern:
Allows child classes to have more flexibilty.
Uses composition over inheritance.

public interface Size{

}
 
public interface ClothingItem{
    void getType();
    Size getSize();
}



The Composite Pattern:
Allows to treat objects and composites of objects in same way.
The client using the composite can ignore differences between composite and its parts.
uses common interface

The decorator pattern:
Interface , concrete implemetation, abstract implemntation
Chenges behvaiour of object dynamically 
n the implementation of this pattern, we prefer composition over an inheritance – so that we can reduce the overhead of subclassing again and again for each decorating element


The Facade pattern:
Facades are needed in software to break down large systems into smaller parts . often with lots of dependencies between them.
client uses simple facade interface.
Simple refactoring.

The Flyweight pattern:
Minimizes memory usage,reuses objects
Factory class with map.
Immutable objects,mutable state,basically caching in hashmap

The Proxy pattern:
Create expensive objects on demand.
Control access to an object.

If one object used in multiple methods/classes, intizle  that object only once by using proxy class


BEHAVORIAL DESIGN PATTERNS

The chain of Responsiblity pattern
Logger prints to console or a file, decided at runtime.
Decoupling is advantage.

creates chain of concrete implementations


The Command Pattern
The request is encapsulated inside an object.
Classes which do the operations are created ,class contains the method/operation.
Can add queus to delay etc
Create classes named command for executing the methods
COmmandExecutor class to call the execute method of each class, adds a layer of abstraction

var lightCommandExecutor=new LightCommandExecutor();
lightCommandExecutor.execut(new TurnOnLightCommand(light));


The Interpreter Pattern


Used for custom regex,compiler, parsing sql
the interpreter defines a grammar, then uses an abstract syntax tree to interpret it.
Context-  AbstractExpression (terminal, non-terminal);

public interface Expression{
    String interpret(String context);
}

public class NoWhiteSpace implements Expresssion{
    @Override
    public String interpret(String context){
        return context.replaceAll(" ","");
    }
}

public class FirstLetterNotLowerCase implements Expresssion{
    
    private final NoWhiteSpace noWhitespace= new NoWhitespace();

    @Override
    public String interpret(String context){
        context=context.substring(0,1).toLowerCase()+context.substring(1);

        return noWhitespace.interpret(context);

    }
}


The Iterator Pattern:

Iterable interface,iterates over collection of objects.

hasNext(),next() methods from iterable to be implemented.

The Mediator pattern

waiter/waitress as mediators in Hotel.
Avoid tight coupling between objects.

Mediator class with all interacting components


The Memento Pattern:
Save the state of object at given time.
Ensuring encapsulation can be challenging with undo operatons.

Originator memento  Caretaker

State class with set and undo method.


The Observer Pattern
Users and newfeed.
Newsfeed -Observer, implemets PropertyChangeListener
Override propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent event){
    statuses.add((String)event.getEvent());
}
User-Observable , uses PropertyChangeSupport.


The state pasttern:
Alters behaviour as state changes.
instead of multiple if else lines.
class for state of object and implement the methods in these

The Startegy Pattern:
conter --> startegy --> stratergy A,B;


Template Method Pattern
Defining common steps in an algorithm in a superclass and redefining some in subclass.
simple inheritance type code.

Visior Patter
Allows to perform an operation on all elements of an object  without making changes to the element themselves.

example file system elements.
more like polymorphism.
create visistor interface and in concrete implemetation create the methods.
