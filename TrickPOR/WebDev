Component has parts: Viw for user interface
JS that contains application logic/event handling for view.

Props:Pass data from parent to child component.
State:conatains data about component. when state changes component will re-render.

Hooks-a way to use local state and other react featire without writing a new class.
Module- a collection of related components , that creates a specific view.

React provides cmd tool to generate a project
npx create-react-app my-app 
cd my-app
npm start - builds the app(compile/transpile), starts server, watcher the source file, rebuilds app when source is updated(hot reload) 
node_modules- stores the installed packages.
manifest.json- provides info about the project name, author,icon etc
App.js- global JS component for React application.
index.html- The main root component.Hooks onto the index.html file to be able to start rendering components.
package-lock.json lock depnedenices to a specific verison number and records verisoning for installation.
npm run build-bundles the app into static files for production.
npm test- starts the test runner.


index.js - finds the dic with id=root and replaces it with App component
index.html is the global DOM.

JSX returns the html DOM from a JS function.

Adding bootstrap:
Get links for remote bootstrap files.
add links to index.html file.
apply bootstrap css styles in component html templates.
apply bootstrap css styles in component html table

jsx looks at className property not class like HTML.

export default TodoRowItem.

JSX returns only one element/div
{} resolves the variable inside the JSX.
onClick={addTodo}-> no parenthesis , because it is pointing to function which will be triggered only if function if event listener is called
eachcomponent handles its own state
Destructing a array in JS
setTodos(todos => [...todos,newTodo])

onChange listener
we can pass function as prop

React key, for each row of table unique
conditional rendering
e.g {showAddTodoForm && <NewTodoForm addTodo={addTodo}/>}
