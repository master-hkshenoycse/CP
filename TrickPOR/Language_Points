Non-static method cannot be referenced from a static context.
Static members are shared among all instances of a class and can be accessed without creating an object of the class.
Non-static methods are associated with instances of a class and cannot be invoked without creating an object. 
They can rely on the specific state of an object, and their behavior may vary depending on the values of instance variables.

Errors are generally caused by problems that cannot be recovered from,
Best course of action is usually to log the error and exit the program.

Exceptions  handle errors that can be recovered from within the program.
Exceptions are represented by the Exception class and its subclasses. Some common examples of exceptions in Java include:

Both Errors and Exceptions are the subclasses of java.lang.Throwable class. 
Error refers to an illegal operation performed by the user which results in the abnormal working of the program. 

Exceptions are divided into two categories:

Checked exceptions

Checked exceptions: like IOException known to the compiler at compile time.
Unchecked exceptions:unchecked exceptions like ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException known to the compiler at runtime,
mostly caused by programmer.
fully checked exception is a checked exception where all its child classes are also checked,
like IOException, and InterruptedException.
A partially checked exception is a checked exception where some of its child classes are unchecked, like an Exception.
FileReader() throws a checked exception FileNotFoundException. 
It also uses readLine() and close() methods, and these methods also throw checked exception IOException


NoClassDefFoundError is an Error that is unchecked in nature, ClassNotFoundException is a checked Exception.
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException is thrown as result Class.forName(), ClassLoader.findSystemClass() and ClassLoader.loadClass() calls.

NoClassDefFoundError is a LinkageError and can come during linking, while java.lang.ClassNotFoundException is an Exception and occurs during runtime.

PATH environment variable is used by the operating system to find any binary 
CLASSPATH is only used by Java ClassLoaders to load class files.
to set CLASSPATH in Java you need to include all those directories where you have put either your .class file or JAR file which is required by your Java application.

CLASSPATH can be overridden by providing command-line option -classpath or -cp to both "java" and "javac" commands or by using Class-Path attribute in Manifest file inside JAR archive.

String class immutable in java.
it is final, which means it is not extendable
storing String literals in the String pool. 


The goal was to reduce count of temporary Strit objects they are shared in string pool, for sharing immutablity is required.
Thread-safety of String objects
String pool is located in PermGen Space of Java Heap, which is very limited as compared to Java Heap. 

from Java 7 onwards, they have moved String pool to normal heap space, which is much much larger than PermGen space.
