Round 1: Data Structures & Algorithms
Format: HackerRank test in the presence of the interviewer.
Questions: Medium to hard level DSA questions.
Experience: The interviewer was helpful, providing directions and hints. I recall one of the questions from LeetCode: "Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area." I was able to solve both questions.

Round 2: System Design Round 1 (1 Hour)
Task: Convert a monolithic architecture into a microservices architecture.
Method: Complete design creation on HackerRank with explanations to the interviewer.
Additional Questions: Basic Java questions focusing on streams and functional interfaces, alongside system design queries.

Round 3: Technical Project Discussion (30 Minutes)
Task: Analyze and find mistakes in a Java code provided on HackerRank, suggest improvements, and answer simple Spring Boot questions.
Approach: Identifying errors and proposing solutions.

Round 4: Hiring Manager Round.
Focus: Discussion about previous work experience and presence of mind.
Questions: "Why JPMC?", leadership skill-related scenarios, and resolving conflicts with a manager.



Round 1: Taken by a developer from JP Morgan [DSA round]

 LC Easy -->https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference/description/
Round 2: Taken by Senior Developer from JP Morgan [Design round]

Question was like there was a exsiting system so we have to improve the exsiting monolith architecture so that it can handle
50x traffic and second was we have a prediction model and a prediction service we have to integrate these two feature in our
exsiting system.
PS: So the question actually was very generic , you just need to explain the different approaches here

Position: Software Engineer - Java position
Time: 120 Mins
PART 1 (30 MINS):
Technical question: similar to LC 1353, Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended (https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/), but worded differently. I took a modified approach that did not have a heap, kinda of like this one LC 435. Non-overlapping Intervals (https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/), and got 11/13 tests cases passing

Neutral exp with interviewer, it seems that they choose the question from a list in HackerRank, so he was not so familar with it

PART 2 (30 MINS):
Design question
design a simple marketplace, like this but more basic https://medium.com/double-pointer/system-design-interview-amazon-flipkart-ebay-or-similar-e-commerce-applications-35a0bc764421

Part 3: (60 mins)
behavioural, pretty easy, basic who are you, why do you want to work here, tell me a time you contributed business value, tell me a time you learn something, etc
