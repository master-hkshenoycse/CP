/*
You are given a sequence of n books, numbered from 1 to n, where each book has a corresponding cost given in the array cost[], such that cost[i] is the cost of the book at position i (0-indexed).

A customer wants to purchase all the books, and a Kindle promotion offers a special discount that allows books to be purchased in one of the following ways:

Discount Options:
Buy the leftmost book individually

Cost: cost[left]

The leftmost book is then removed from the sequence.

Buy the rightmost book individually

Cost: cost[right]

The rightmost book is then removed from the sequence.

Buy both the leftmost and rightmost books together

Cost: pairCost

Both books are removed from the sequence.

This option can be used at most k times.

Goal:
Determine the minimum total cost required to purchase all the books using the above discount strategy.
