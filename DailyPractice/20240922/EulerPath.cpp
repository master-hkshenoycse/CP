//Given an unidrected Graph, necessary conditions for Euler Circuit to exist
//Below conditions ensure that an Euler path can traverse all edges exactly once.
//should be connected
//If all nodes have even degree(Circut exist)
//Exactly Two nodes can have odd degree (Circuit does not exist only Path exists)
